# Fix PR Merge Issue - Deployment Error

## Problem
The "Confirm Merge" button is not showing because:
- Vercel deployment failed for this branch
- GitHub checks are failing
- Branch protection rules may require checks to pass

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Merge Anyway (If Deployment Error is Not Critical)

If the deployment error is just due to missing environment variables (which you'll set after merging), you can merge anyway:

1. **Scroll down on the PR page** to find the "Checks" section
2. **Look for "Merge without waiting for requirements to be met"** link (if available)
3. Or check if there's a dropdown arrow next to the merge button that says "Merge when ready"

### Option 2: Fix the Deployment Error First

The deployment error might be because:
- Missing Twilio environment variables in Vercel
- Build errors due to TypeScript/compilation issues

**To check the error:**
1. Click on the "Checks" tab in your PR
2. Click on the failed check (likely Vercel deployment)
3. View the error logs to see what failed

### Option 3: Disable Required Checks Temporarily

If you need to merge urgently and the error is just about environment variables:

1. Go to: Repository Settings → Branches
2. Find branch protection rules for `main`
3. Temporarily disable required checks (if you have permission)
4. Merge the PR
5. Re-enable the checks

**Note:** Only do this if you're confident the code is correct and the error is just configuration.

### Option 4: Fix Environment Variables

If the build is failing due to missing environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add these for the feature branch or all branches:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (can be a dummy value for now)
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (can be a dummy value for now)
   - `TWILIO_SMS_FROM`
   - `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM`

### Option 5: Check Build Locally First

Make sure the code builds successfully locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

If there are build errors, fix them first before merging.
