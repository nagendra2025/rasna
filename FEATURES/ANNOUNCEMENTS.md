## Overview

The Announcements feature provides a simple, read-only messaging system for broadcasting short messages to the entire family. Unlike chat or messaging systems, announcements are one-way communications with no replies, threads, or discussions. They support optional auto-expiry for time-sensitive messages.

---

## Purpose

According to the PRD, this feature serves as:
- Broadcast short messages without discussion noise
- Read-only messages (no replies, no threads)
- Optional auto-expiry for time-sensitive announcements
- Examples: "Dinner at 8 PM", "Leaving at 6:30 AM tomorrow"

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/announcements
**Description:** List all active (non-expired) announcements  
**Authentication:** Required  
**Authorization:** All authenticated users can view

**Response:**
```json
{
  "announcements": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "message": "Dinner at 8 PM tonight",
      "expires_at": null,
      "created_by": "user-uuid",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "message": "Leaving at 6:30 AM tomorrow",
      "expires_at": "2024-01-16T06:30:00Z",

```json
{
  "message": "Leaving at 6:30 AM tomorrow",
  "expires_at": "2024-01-16T06:30:00Z"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "announcement": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "message": "Dinner at 8 PM tonight",
    "expires_at": null,

- `400` - Message is required or empty
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Profile not found
- `500` - Server error

## Database Schema

### Table: `announcements`

```sql
CREATE TABLE announcements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexes
- `idx_announcements_expires_at` - On `expires_at` column for filtering performance

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**View Policy:**
- All authenticated users can view active announcements
- Query filters: `expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > NOW()`

**Create Policy:**
- All authenticated users can create announcements

**Delete Policy:**
- All authenticated users can delete announcements

**Note:** No update policy - announcements are read-only once created (can only be deleted)

---

## Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Next.js 15** - Framework
- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Styling
- **date-fns** - Date formatting and manipulation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Supabase** - Database and authentication
- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Supabase client library
- **@supabase/ssr** - Server-side Supabase utilities

### Database Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase)
- **profiles table** - For user reference

---

## Expiry Logic

### Expiry Types

1. **No Expiry** (`expires_at = NULL`)
   - Announcement remains active indefinitely
   - Displayed until manually deleted

2. **Date Only** (`expires_at = '2024-01-16T23:59:59Z'`)
   - Expires at end of specified date
   - Default behavior when only date is provided

3. **Date + Time** (`expires_at = '2024-01-16T06:30:00Z'`)
   - Expires at specific date and time
   - More precise control

### Expiry Display

- **No Expiry:** No expiry information shown
- **Future (> 24 hours):** "Expires: [date] at [time]"
- **Urgent (< 24 hours):** "Expires in X hour(s)" (orange text)

### Auto-Removal

- **Server-side:** Database query filters out expired announcements
- **Client-side:** Auto-refresh every 60 seconds removes expired announcements
- **On Load:** Page load only shows active announcements

---

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Simple Announcement (No Expiry)
```
Message: "Dinner at 8 PM tonight"
Expiry: None
```

### 2. Time-Sensitive Announcement
```
Message: "Leaving at 6:30 AM tomorrow"
Expiry: Tomorrow at 6:30 AM
```

### 3. Daily Reminder
```
Message: "Grocery shopping this afternoon"
Expiry: Today at 4:00 PM
```

### 4. Weekend Event
```
Message: "Family meeting this weekend"
Expiry: 3 days from now
```

### 5. Quick Notice
```
Message: "School pickup changed to 4 PM"
Expiry: Today at 4:00 PM
```

## Security Considerations

1. **RLS Policies** - All database operations protected by Row Level Security
2. **API Authorization** - Server-side checks for authentication
3. **Input Validation** - Message required and trimmed
4. **SQL Injection** - Protected by Supabase parameterized queries
5. **XSS Prevention** - React automatically escapes content

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes** - Expiry index for fast filtering
2. **Client-Side Filtering** - Backup filtering in browser
3. **Auto-Refresh** - Efficient 60-second interval
4. **Database Query** - Optimized with `OR` condition for expiry
5. **No Pagination** - Not needed for family scale

---

## Design Philosophy

### Read-Only by Design
- No replies
- No threads
- No discussions
- Just announcements

This keeps the feature simple and focused on one-way communication, reducing noise and maintaining clarity.

### Auto-Expiry
- Prevents announcement clutter
- Automatically removes outdated information
- Time-sensitive messages naturally expire

### Simple UI
- Clean card layout
- Minimal information
- Focus on message content
- No complex interactions

---

## Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 1)

- Rich text formatting
- Announcement categories
- Priority levels
- Scheduled announcements
- Announcement templates
- Email notifications for new announcements
- Push notifications

---

- Check API query: `expires_at > NOW()`

### Issue: Can't create announcement
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're authenticated
- Check Network tab for API response
- Verify message field is not empty

### Issue: Delete not working
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API call is successful (Network tab)
- Check RLS policies allow deletion
- Verify announcement ID is correct

### Issue: Expiry not working
**Solution:**
- Verify date/time format is correct
- Check timezone settings
- Verify database `expires_at` column
- Check auto-refresh is running
