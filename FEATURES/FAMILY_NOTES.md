## Database Schema

### Table: `notes`

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('emergency', 'health', 'school', 'general')) DEFAULT 'general',
  is_readonly_for_kids BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexes
- `idx_notes_category` - On `category` column for filtering performance

### Row Level Security (RLS)

**View Policy:**
- All authenticated users can view all notes

**Create Policy:**
- Only parents (father, mother, parent roles) can create notes

**Update Policy:**
- Only parents can update notes
- Additional check: If `is_readonly_for_kids` is true, only parents can edit

**Delete Policy:**
- Only parents can delete notes

---

## Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Next.js 15** - Framework
- **React 19** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Styling

### Backend Dependencies
- **Supabase** - Database and authentication
- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Supabase client library
- **@supabase/ssr** - Server-side Supabase utilities

### Database Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase)
- **profiles table** - For role-based access control

---

## Role-Based Access Control

### Parent Roles
Users with these roles can create, edit, and delete notes:
- `'father'`
- `'mother'`
- `'parent'`

### Kid Roles
Users with these roles can only view notes:
- `'son'`
- `'daughter'`
- `'child'`

### Permission Logic

```typescript
// Check if user is parent
const isParent = ["father", "mother", "parent"].includes(profile.role);

// API checks
if (!isParent) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Only parents can create/edit/delete notes" },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **RLS Policies** - All database operations protected by Row Level Security
2. **API Authorization** - Server-side checks for parent role
3. **Client-Side Hiding** - UI elements hidden for kids, but API also enforces
4. **Input Validation** - Required fields validated on both client and server
5. **SQL Injection** - Protected by Supabase parameterized queries

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes** - Category index for fast filtering
2. **Client-Side Filtering** - Filtering done in browser for instant response
3. **Grid Layout** - CSS Grid for efficient rendering
4. **Lazy Loading** - Notes loaded on page load, no pagination needed (family scale)

---

## Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 1)

- Rich text editor for formatting
- Note search functionality
- Note attachments
- Note version history
- Note sharing with external family members
- Note templates
- Note expiration dates

---

## Related Features

- **Authentication** - Required for access
- **Profiles** - Role-based access control
- **Navigation** - Links to Notes page
- **Home Dashboard** - Card linking to Notes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't create notes
**Solution:** Check user role in `profiles` table. Must be 'father', 'mother', or 'parent'.

### Issue: Kids can see edit buttons
**Solution:** Verify profile role is 'son', 'daughter', or 'child'. Check API authorization.

### Issue: Notes not appearing
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify RLS policies are active. Check Network tab for API responses.

### Issue: Category filter not working
**Solution:** Verify category values match exactly: 'emergency', 'health', 'school', 'general'.
