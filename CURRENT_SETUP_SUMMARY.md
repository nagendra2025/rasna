# Current Notification Setup - Summary

## ✅ Setup Complete

### WhatsApp Notifications
- **Status**: ✅ Working (within 24-hour window)
- **How it works**: 
  - Family members send WhatsApp message to Twilio number daily
  - This opens a 24-hour window for freeform messages
  - Notifications sent via WhatsApp when window is open
- **Twilio WhatsApp Number**: `+1 415 523 8886` (or your configured number)
- **Note**: Window expires after 24 hours, so family needs to message daily

### SMS Notifications
- **Status**: ✅ Always working
- **How it works**: 
  - No 24-hour window restriction
  - Notifications sent via SMS regardless
  - Works independently of WhatsApp
- **Note**: SMS will always work, even if WhatsApp window is closed

## Daily Routine

### For Family Members:

## Important Notes

### WhatsApp 24-Hour Window
- **Requirement**: Family members must message Twilio daily
- **Purpose**: Keeps WhatsApp notification window open
- **Alternative**: SMS always works regardless

### SMS Reliability
- **Always works**: No 24-hour window restriction
- **Backup**: SMS ensures notifications are always delivered
- **Primary**: SMS is the most reliable channel

### Future Consideration
- **Message Templates**: Can be implemented later for production
- **No 24-hour window**: Templates work anytime
- **Requires approval**: 1-2 weeks for WhatsApp approval

## Testing

### Test Endpoints
- **Diagnostics**: `/test-notifications` → "🔍 Run Diagnostics"
- **Test Reminders**: `/test-notifications` → "Test Reminders Endpoint"
- **Test Manual Send**: `/test-notifications` → "Test Manual Notification Send"

### Verification
- Check Vercel logs for cron execution
- Check Twilio Console → Monitor → Logs → Messaging
- Verify notifications received on phones

## Summary

**Current Approach**: 24-hour window for WhatsApp + SMS always working

**Status**: ✅ Everything configured and working

**Next Steps**: 
- Family members message Twilio daily to keep WhatsApp window open
