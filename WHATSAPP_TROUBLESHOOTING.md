# WhatsApp Notification Troubleshooting

## Issue: WhatsApp Notifications Not Received

### Problem
- API returns `"whatsapp": true` (success)
- But no WhatsApp messages are actually received
- SMS notifications work fine

### Common Causes

#### 1. Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox Restrictions
**Most Common Issue**: Twilio WhatsApp uses a sandbox for testing. Recipients must join the sandbox first.

**How to Check:**
- Go to Twilio Console → Messaging → Try it out → Send a WhatsApp message
- Check if your phone number is registered in the sandbox

**Solution:**
1. Send a WhatsApp message to your Twilio WhatsApp number (from `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM`)
2. Send the join code (e.g., "join [code]")
3. Once joined, you can receive messages

**Note**: In production, you need to register your WhatsApp Business number with Twilio.

#### 2. Phone Number Format
**Check**: Phone numbers must be in E.164 format with `whatsapp:` prefix

**Correct Format:**
- `whatsapp:+1234567890` ✅
- `+1234567890` ✅ (code adds prefix automatically)
- `1234567890` ❌ (missing country code)
- `whatsapp:1234567890` ❌ (missing country code)

#### 3. Twilio Response Status
**Issue**: Twilio might return "queued" status, but message fails later

**Check**: Look at the detailed error in the response:
```json
{
  "whatsappDetails": {
    "twilioError": {
      "code": "21608",
      "message": "The number is not registered in WhatsApp",
      "status": "failed"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Twilio WhatsApp Configuration
**Check**: Verify `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` is correct

**Format**: Should be `whatsapp:+14155238886` (Twilio sandbox number)
- Or your registered WhatsApp Business number

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Server Logs
Look for detailed WhatsApp logs:
```
[WhatsApp] Attempting to send to: whatsapp:+1234567890, from: whatsapp:+14155238886
[WhatsApp] Twilio response: { sid: "...", status: "queued", ... }
```

### Step 2: Check API Response
After clicking "Test Manual Notification Send", look for:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Nag",
      "whatsapp": true,  // This might be true even if not delivered
      "whatsappDetails": {
        "twilioError": {
          "code": "...",
          "message": "...",
          "status": "..."
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Check Twilio Console
1. Go to Twilio Console → Messaging → Logs
2. Look for your WhatsApp messages
3. Check the status:
   - `queued` = Message is queued (might still fail)
   - `sent` = Message sent to Twilio
   - `delivered` = Message delivered to recipient
   - `failed` = Message failed (check error code)
