### Step 5.3: Configure Project

Vercel will auto-detect your framework (Next.js), but you can verify:

**Project Settings:**

**For Rasna:** All defaults should work perfectly!

### Step 5.4: Environment Variables (Important!)

**DO NOT deploy yet!** First, add environment variables:

1. **Expand "Environment Variables" section**

2. **Add these variables:**

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   ```
   - Value: Your Supabase project URL
   - Example: `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`
   - Add to: Production, Preview, Development (all three)

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   ```
   - Value: Your Supabase anon/public key
   - Example: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   - Add to: Production, Preview, Development (all three)

3. **How to Add:**
   - Click **"Add"** or **"Add Another"**
   - Enter variable name
   - Enter variable value
   - Select environments (check all three boxes)
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Where to Get Values:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Project Settings → API
   - Copy "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### Step 5.5: Review Settings

Before deploying, verify:

---

## 6. Configuring Environment Variables

### Step 6.1: Add Environment Variables

**Required Variables:**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[your-project-id].supabase.co

```

### Step 6.2: Environment Selection

For each variable, select:
- ✅ **Production** - Live site
- ✅ **Preview** - Branch deployments
- ✅ **Development** - Local development (if using Vercel CLI)

### Step 6.3: Adding Variables After Deployment

If you forgot to add variables:

1. Go to **Project Settings → Environment Variables**
2. Add variables
3. **Redeploy** (variables only apply to new deployments)

### Step 6.4: Secure Variables

- ✅ Never commit `.env.local` to Git
- ✅ Use Vercel dashboard for production secrets
- ✅ Variables are encrypted at rest
- ✅ Only accessible during build/runtime

## 7. Deployment Settings

### Step 7.1: Build Settings (Auto-Configured)

Vercel automatically detects Next.js and sets:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",

  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

**For Rasna:** No changes needed!
