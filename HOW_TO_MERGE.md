## Method 2: Using Git Commands (Command Line)

If you prefer using the command line:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Switch to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull latest changes from remote:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   This ensures your local main is up-to-date.

3. **Merge your feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git merge Creating-whatsapp-notfication-for-events-tasks
   ```
   
   If there are conflicts, resolve them, then:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merge feature branch: WhatsApp and SMS notifications"
   ```

4. **Push to remote main:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Optional - Delete the feature branch:**
   ```bash
   # Delete local branch
   git branch -d Creating-whatsapp-notfication-for-events-tasks
   
   # Delete remote branch
   git push origin --delete Creating-whatsapp-notfication-for-events-tasks
   ```

## After Merging

### 1. Run Database Migrations (In Supabase)
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run: `supabase/migrations/009_add_notifications.sql`
   - Run: `supabase/migrations/010_add_app_settings.sql`

### 2. Verify Environment Variables (In Vercel)
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify these are set:
     - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
     - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
     - `TWILIO_SMS_FROM`
     - `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM`

### 3. Verify Deployment
   - Check that Vercel automatically deployed the new code
   - Verify the Settings page works: `https://your-domain.com/settings`

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "This branch has conflicts":
   - Click "Resolve conflicts" button
   - GitHub will show you the conflicting files
   - Resolve conflicts manually or click "Resolve using theirs/ours"
   - Click "Mark as resolved" and commit

### If merge fails:
   - Make sure your local main is up-to-date: `git pull origin main`
   - Make sure feature branch is pushed: `git push origin Creating-whatsapp-notfication-for-events-tasks`

### If you don't see your branch in the dropdown:
