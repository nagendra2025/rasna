## 🎨 Visual Design Concept

│  [Calendar] [Tasks] [Notes] ...         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Meet the Family                        │
│  ────────────────────────────────────  │
│                                         │
│  [Photo]  [Photo]  [Photo]  [Photo]   │
│  Name     Name     Name     Name       │
│  Role     Role     Role     Role       │
│  Age      Age      Age      Age        │
│                                         │
│  [View Full Family →]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Profile Card Design
- **Circular or rounded photo** (like a family photo wall)
- **Name** prominently displayed
- **Role badge** (Father, Mother, Son, Daughter)
- **Age** (calculated from date of birth)
- **Hover effect** - slight lift/shadow
- **Clickable** - could show quick stats or link to their page

---

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Enhancement

**Add to `profiles` table:**
- `photo_url` (TEXT) - Profile photo URL
- `date_of_birth` (DATE) - Date of birth
- `bio` (TEXT, optional) - Short bio/description

### Phase 2: Home Page Section

**Location:** Bottom of home page, after feature cards

**Features:**
- Fetch all family profiles
- Display in a horizontal scrollable row (or grid)
- Show photo, name, role, age
- "View Full Family" link to dedicated page
- Beautiful, welcoming design

### Phase 3: Family Page (Optional but Recommended)

**Location:** `/family` page

**Features:**
- Full profile cards with more details
- Edit profile functionality
- Upload profile photos
- More space for additional info
- Could show:
  - Their tasks count
  - Their events count
  - Recent activity
  - Bio/description

## 💡 Creative Ideas

### 1. **Family Photo Wall Style**
- Circular photos in a row
- Like a real family photo wall
- Warm, personal feeling

### 2. **Interactive Cards**
- Hover shows quick stats:
  - "3 tasks this week"
  - "2 upcoming events"
  - "Member since [date]"

### 3. **Role-Based Colors**
- Father: Blue accent
- Mother: Pink accent
- Son: Green accent
- Daughter: Purple accent
- Matches existing design system

### 4. **Age Display**
- "Age 20" or "20 years old"
- Could show birthday countdown if upcoming
- "Turning 21 in 45 days!"

### 5. **Welcome Message**
- "Meet the [Family Name] Family"
- Or "Our Family" with a heart icon

      <FamilyMemberCard key={profile.id} profile={profile} />
    ))}
  </div>
  <div className="mt-6 text-center">
    <Link href="/family" className="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700">

  </div>
</section>
```
