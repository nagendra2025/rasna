-- VERIFY RLS POLICIES FOR EDIT RESTRICTIONS

-- Run this script in Supabase SQL Editor to verify
-- that the migration 008 was applied correctly

-- Check if RLS is enabled on all tables

FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('tasks', 'events', 'notes', 'memories')

-- Check all policies on tasks table

-- Expected Results:
-- =================
-- Tasks table should have:
--   - "Users can update their own tasks" (UPDATE policy with created_by = auth.uid())
--   - "Users can delete their own tasks" (DELETE policy with created_by = auth.uid())
--
-- Events table should have:
--   - "Users can update their own events" (UPDATE policy with created_by = auth.uid())
--   - "Users can delete their own events" (DELETE policy with created_by = auth.uid())
--
-- Notes table should have:
--   - "Parents can update their own notes" (UPDATE policy with created_by = auth.uid() AND parent role check)
--   - "Parents can delete their own notes" (DELETE policy with created_by = auth.uid() AND parent role check)
--
-- Memories table should have:
--   - "Users can update their own memories" (UPDATE policy with created_by = auth.uid())
--   - "Users can delete their own memories" (DELETE policy with created_by = auth.uid())
