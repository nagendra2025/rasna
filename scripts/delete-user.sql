-- USER DELETION SCRIPT
-- ============================================
-- This script deletes a user and all associated data
-- WARNING: This permanently deletes all user data!
--
-- Usage:
-- 1. Replace 'USER_UUID_HERE' with the actual user UUID
-- 2. Run this script in Supabase SQL Editor
-- 3. Verify deletion in Table Editor
--
-- Note: Due to ON DELETE CASCADE, deleting from auth.users
-- will automatically delete:
-- - User's profile (from profiles table)
-- - All events created by that user
-- - All tasks created by that user
-- - All notes created by that user
-- - All announcements created by that user
-- - All memories created by that user
--
-- IMPORTANT: Storage files (photos) are NOT automatically deleted.
-- Run cleanup-storage.sql after deleting users to clean up orphaned files.

-- ============================================
-- STEP 1: Find the user UUID
-- ============================================
-- Uncomment and run this to find the user UUID by email:
-- SELECT id, email, created_at 
-- FROM auth.users 
-- WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- ============================================
-- STEP 2: Delete the user (replace UUID)
-- ============================================
-- Replace 'USER_UUID_HERE' with the actual UUID from Step 1
-- DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = 'USER_UUID_HERE';

-- ============================================
-- STEP 3: Verify deletion
-- ============================================
-- After deletion, verify:
-- SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = 'USER_UUID_HERE'; -- Should return nothing
-- SELECT * FROM events WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE'; -- Should return nothing
-- SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE'; -- Should return nothing
-- SELECT * FROM notes WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE'; -- Should return nothing
-- SELECT * FROM announcements WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE'; -- Should return nothing
-- SELECT * FROM memories WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE'; -- Should return nothing

-- ============================================
-- BULK DELETE EXAMPLE (Multiple Users)
-- ============================================
-- To delete multiple users by email pattern:
-- DELETE FROM auth.users 
-- WHERE email IN (
--   'user1@example.com',
--   'user2@example.com',
--   'user3@example.com'
-- );

-- ============================================
-- SAFE DELETE (Check before deleting)
-- ============================================
-- Before deleting, you can check what will be deleted:
-- 
-- Check user's profile:
-- SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = 'USER_UUID_HERE';
-- 
-- Check user's events:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) as event_count FROM events WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE';
-- 
-- Check user's tasks:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) as task_count FROM tasks WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE';
-- 
-- Check user's notes:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) as note_count FROM notes WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE';
-- 
-- Check user's announcements:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) as announcement_count FROM announcements WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE';
-- 
-- Check user's memories:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) as memory_count FROM memories WHERE created_by = 'USER_UUID_HERE';
