## How It Works

### Daily Flow
1. **8:00 AM UTC**: Vercel Cron triggers `/api/notifications/good-morning`
2. **Get Quote**: Fetches daily quote (OpenAI → Quotable → Fallback)
3. **Get Profiles**: Finds all family members with WhatsApp enabled
4. **Send Messages**: Sends personalized WhatsApp message to each:
   ```
   🌅 Good Morning, [Name]!
   
   [Daily Quote]
   
   Have a wonderful day! 💙
   ```
5. **Log Results**: Logs success/failure for monitoring

## Environment Variables Required

### Already Configured
- ✅ `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- ✅ `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- ✅ `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM`

### New Required
- ⚠️ **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** - Add this to Vercel environment variables

### Optional
- `CRON_SECRET` - For cron authentication (if set)

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key to Vercel
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (all)
3. Save

### Step 2: Deploy to Production
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add daily good morning feature with quote service"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Check Vercel deployment succeeds
- Verify cron job is configured
- Check logs after first execution

---

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Go to: `https://your-domain.com/api/notifications/good-morning`
2. Should return JSON response with quote and results
3. Check WhatsApp messages received

### Test Quote Service
```typescript
// Test in Node.js or browser console
import { getDailyQuote } from '@/lib/services/quotes';

const result = await getDailyQuote();
console.log(result);
// Should show: { quote: "...", source: "openai" | "quotable" | "fallback" }
```

### Test Endpoint Locally
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/good-morning
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### First Execution (8:00 AM UTC)
- ✅ Fetches quote from OpenAI (or Quotable if OpenAI fails)
- ✅ Sends WhatsApp message to all family members
- ✅ Keeps 24-hour window open
- ✅ Logs results

### Subsequent Executions
- ✅ Same flow daily
- ✅ Different quote each day
- ✅ Window stays open
- ✅ Regular notifications work at 9:00 AM UTC

---

## Monitoring

### Check Logs
1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Deployments → Latest → Functions
2. Look for `/api/notifications/good-morning` logs
3. Check for:
   - Quote source (openai/quotable/fallback)
   - Messages sent count
   - Any errors

### Check WhatsApp
- Family members should receive message daily at 8:00 AM UTC
- Message includes personalized name and quote
- WhatsApp only (no SMS)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No quotes generated
**Check:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
- OpenAI API key is valid
- Quotable API is accessible (fallback)

### Issue: No WhatsApp messages sent
**Check:**
- App-level notifications enabled
- WhatsApp enabled at app level
- Family members have WhatsApp enabled
- Phone numbers are valid
- 24-hour window is open (first time)

### Issue: Cron not executing
**Check:**
- `vercel.json` is deployed
- Cron schedule is correct (`0 8 * * *`)
- Vercel cron is enabled for your plan

---

## Cost Estimate

### OpenAI API
- **Per day**: 1 call × ~$0.0001 = $0.0001
- **Per month**: ~$0.003
- **Per year**: ~$0.04

### Quotable API
- **Cost**: Free

### Twilio WhatsApp
- **Per message**: Same as existing notifications
- **5 messages/day**: 5 × existing rate
- **Additional cost**: Minimal

### Total Additional Cost
- **Monthly**: ~$0.01 (practically free)

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- ✅ Sends daily at 8:00 AM UTC
- ✅ Includes unique quote
- ✅ Sends to all family members
- ✅ WhatsApp only (no SMS)
- ✅ Keeps 24-hour window open

### Non-Functional
- ✅ Reliable (99%+ success rate)
- ✅ Fast execution (< 30 seconds)
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Vercel**
2. ✅ **Deploy to production**
3. ✅ **Monitor first execution**
4. ✅ **Verify WhatsApp delivery**
5. ✅ **Check 24-hour window stays open**
