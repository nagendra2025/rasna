# Phase 1 Verification Guide

## ✅ Phase 1: Database & Backend Updates - COMPLETE

### What Was Done

1. **Created Migration:** `supabase/migrations/006_enhanced_signup.sql`
   - Added `gender` field to `profiles` table
   - Added `nick_name` field to `profiles` table
   - Updated `handle_new_user()` trigger function to accept all new fields
   - Added indexes on `gender` and `nick_name`

### How to Verify

#### Step 1: Apply the Migration

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Run the Migration**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/006_enhanced_signup.sql`
   - Copy the entire SQL content
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - Wait for success confirmation ✅

#### Step 2: Verify Database Changes

Run these queries in SQL Editor to verify:

**Check if gender column exists:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
AND column_name = 'gender';
```

**Expected Result:** Should show `gender` column with type `text`

**Check if nick_name column exists:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
AND column_name = 'nick_name';
```

**Expected Result:** Should show `nick_name` column with type `text`

**Check if indexes were created:**
```sql
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'profiles'
AND indexname IN ('idx_profiles_gender', 'idx_profiles_nick_name');
```

**Expected Result:** Should show 2 rows (one for each index)

**Verify trigger function was updated:**
```sql
SELECT routine_name, routine_definition
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_name = 'handle_new_user';
```

**Expected Result:** Should show the function with updated definition

#### Step 3: Check Current Profiles Table Structure

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

**Expected Columns:**
- id
- email
- name
- role
- created_at
- updated_at
- photo_url (from migration 005)
- date_of_birth (from migration 005)
- bio (from migration 005)
- gender (NEW - from migration 006)
- nick_name (NEW - from migration 006)

### ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Migration ran successfully (no errors)
- [ ] `gender` column exists in `profiles` table
- [ ] `nick_name` column exists in `profiles` table
- [ ] Indexes `idx_profiles_gender` and `idx_profiles_nick_name` exist
- [ ] `handle_new_user()` function was updated
- [ ] All existing profiles still accessible (no data loss)

### If You See Errors

**Error: "column already exists"**
- ✅ This is OK - the migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS`
- The column was already added manually
- Continue with verification

**Error: "function already exists"**
- ✅ This is OK - the migration uses `CREATE OR REPLACE`
- The function was updated successfully
- Continue with verification

**Error: "permission denied"**
- Make sure you're running as project owner
- Check you have proper database permissions
