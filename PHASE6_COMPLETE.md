## How to Use

### Deleting a Single User

1. **Find User UUID:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, created_at 
   FROM auth.users 
   WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```

2. **Delete User:**
   - Open `scripts/delete-user.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Replace `USER_UUID_HERE` with the actual UUID
   - Run the DELETE statement

3. **Delete Storage Files:**
   - Go to Storage → memories bucket
   - Delete `profiles/{user-uuid}/` folder

4. **Verify:**
   - Check that user is gone from auth.users
   - Check that all user's data is deleted
   - Verify storage files are deleted

---

### Bulk User Deletion

```sql
-- Delete multiple users by email
DELETE FROM auth.users 
WHERE email IN (
  'user1@example.com',
  'user2@example.com',
  'user3@example.com'
);
```

---

### Finding Orphaned Storage Files

1. Run queries from `scripts/cleanup-storage.sql`
2. Identify orphaned files
3. Delete manually via Storage Dashboard

---

## Safety Features

- Queries to check what will be deleted before deletion
- Step-by-step instructions
- Clear warnings about permanent deletion

## Next Steps

The cleanup scripts are utility tools that can be used as needed. They don't require testing in the normal flow, but you can:

1. **Test on a test user** (if you have one)
2. **Review the scripts** to understand how they work
3. **Use them when needed** to clean up users or storage
