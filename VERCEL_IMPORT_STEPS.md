# Quick Guide: Importing Existing GitHub Repository to Vercel

## Current Situation

You're on the "New Project" page and see:
- ✅ **Repository:** `nagendra2025/rasna` (correct!)
- ❓ **Git Scope:** Dropdown field
- ❓ **Private Repository Name:** Pre-filled with "my-repository"

## What to Do

### Option 1: Import Your Existing GitHub Repo (Recommended)

**Since you already have `nagendra2025/rasna` on GitHub, you should import it directly:**

1. **Click "Import a different Git Repository →"** (link at the bottom of the form)
2. This will take you to a page where you can:
   - Search for your existing repository
   - Select `nagendra2025/rasna`
   - Import it directly

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ Uses your existing GitHub repository
- ✅ No need to create a new repository
- ✅ All your existing commits and history are preserved
- ✅ Simpler setup

### Option 2: If You Must Fill the Current Form

If you can't find the "Import" link or want to proceed with the current form:

1. **Git Scope:**
   - Select: `nagendra2025` (your GitHub username)
   - Or select your GitHub organization if the repo is under an organization

2. **Private Repository Name:**
   - You can leave it as `my-repository` (it won't affect your GitHub repo)
   - Or change it to `rasna` to match your project name
   - **Note:** This creates a NEW repository on Vercel, not your existing GitHub one

3. **Click "Create"**
   - This will create a new Vercel-managed Git repository
   - You'll need to connect it to your GitHub repo later

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1** - Click "Import a different Git Repository →" to import your existing `nagendra2025/rasna` repository directly.

This is the standard way to deploy an existing GitHub repository to Vercel.

## Next Steps After Import

Once you've imported your repository:

1. **Configure Project Settings:**
   - Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` (default)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (auto-detected)

2. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Select all three environments (Production, Preview, Development)

3. **Deploy!**

**Quick Answer:**
- **Git Scope:** `nagendra2025` (your GitHub username)
- **Private Repository Name:** Not needed if importing existing repo - click "Import a different Git Repository →" instead
