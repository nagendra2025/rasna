# Fix: "Choose a Git provider to continue" Error on Vercel

## Problem

You're seeing a red error message: **"Choose a Git provider to continue."**

This means Vercel doesn't have access to your GitHub account or the connection needs to be refreshed.

## Solution: Connect GitHub to Vercel

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Settings

1. **Click on your profile/avatar** (top right corner of Vercel dashboard)
2. Select **"Settings"** from the dropdown menu
3. Or go directly to: [vercel.com/account](https://vercel.com/account)

### Step 2: Connect Git Provider

1. **In Settings, look for "Git" section** (usually in the left sidebar)
2. **Click on "Git"** or "Connected Git Providers"
3. You'll see a list of Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

### Step 3: Connect GitHub

1. **Find "GitHub" in the list**
2. **Click "Connect"** or **"Connect GitHub"** button
3. You'll be redirected to GitHub authorization page

### Step 4: Authorize Vercel

1. **On GitHub authorization page:**
   - Review the permissions Vercel is requesting
   - Click **"Authorize Vercel"** or **"Authorize"** button
   - You may need to enter your GitHub password

2. **Choose Repository Access:**
   - **Option 1:** "All repositories" (recommended for personal projects)
   - **Option 2:** "Only select repositories" (more secure, choose `nagendra2025/rasna`)

3. **Click "Install"** or **"Authorize"**

### Step 5: Return to Vercel

1. **You'll be redirected back to Vercel**
2. **GitHub should now show as "Connected"** in your Git settings
3. **Go back to "New Project" page**

### Step 6: Try Importing Again

1. **Go back to:** [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. **Click "Import Project"** or **"Add New..." → "Project"**
3. **You should now see your repositories**, including `nagendra2025/rasna`
4. **Click on `nagendra2025/rasna`** to import it

## Alternative: Quick Fix from Current Page

If you're still on the "New Project" page:

1. **Look for a link or button** that says:
   - "Connect GitHub"
   - "Authorize GitHub"
   - "Git Provider Settings"
   - Or similar

2. **Click it** and follow the authorization steps above

## If GitHub is Already Connected

If GitHub shows as "Connected" but you still see the error:

### Option 1: Refresh Connection

1. Go to **Settings → Git**
2. Find **GitHub** in the list
3. Click **"Disconnect"** or **"Reconnect"**
4. Re-authorize GitHub
5. Try importing again

### Option 2: Check Repository Access

1. Go to **Settings → Git**
2. Verify GitHub has access to your repositories
3. If using "Selected repositories", make sure `nagendra2025/rasna` is included
4. If not, click **"Configure"** and add it

### Option 3: Use "Import" Instead

1. **Don't use the "Clone" option** (the page you're on)
2. **Click "Import a different Git Repository →"** (at the bottom)
3. This will show a list of your connected repositories
4. Select `nagendra2025/rasna` from the list

## Recommended Approach

**Instead of using the "Clone" page, use the standard import:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. **Click "Add New..." → "Project"**
3. **You'll see a list of your GitHub repositories**
4. **Search for "rasna"** or find `nagendra2025/rasna`
5. **Click on it** to import

This is the standard way and avoids the "Clone" page issues.
